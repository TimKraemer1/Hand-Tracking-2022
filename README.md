README - 2022 Hand-Tracking Project

This program is a crude project with the intent to practice and learn new python libraries and techniques, as well as reinforce already learned skills
The project allows a user to, using a webcam, manipulate the mouse clicker on the screen using hand movement, aswell as clicks using hand signals

REQUIREMENTS TO RUN

Make sure you have these libraries installed before you try:

-cvs

-mediapipe

-pyautogui

RUNNING

When running, a window that mirrors the webcams view will appear with landmark tracking nodes on your hand. Its best to already have your hand in frame
before starting the program. 

To left click, pinch your index fingerand thumb together

LIMITATIONS

Due to the placement of the tracking nodes on the hand, it is currently impossible to move the cursor into the edges of the monitor. This will be
attempted at fixing in a future iteration.

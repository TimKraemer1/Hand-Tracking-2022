# 2022 Hand Tracking Project

This project is a simple implementation of real-time hand tracking using a webcam, designed as a learning exercise to explore new Python libraries and techniques, while reinforcing existing programming skills.

The application allows users to control their mouse cursor with hand movements and perform click actions using hand gestures.
